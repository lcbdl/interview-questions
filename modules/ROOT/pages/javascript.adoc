= JavaScript & TypeScript

== 1. Explain JavaScript var, let, and const
    • Global Scope:  All of them can create a global variable or constant if you declare it in a file by out site of any functions.
    • Function Scope:  All of them can create a function scope by declaring it in site a function
    • Block Scope:  var can’t declare a block scope variable, but let and const can.
    • Hoisting:  you can use a variable before declaring it.  Var can, but let.
    • Re-declaration:  Var can, but let or const.

== 2. How to make a const object a real const(readonly)
